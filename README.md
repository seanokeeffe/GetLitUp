GetLitUp
========

How is it that in the thousands of years that sports have been around the best synchronized cheering motion humans have been able to successfully pull of is the wave? From the first competitions in Athens to our giant stadiums today, the wave is still the best we've come up with. We are aiming to change that.

GetLitUp is the next step in synchronized crowd participation for sporting events. Simply by providing your current stadium, your section and seat number, GetLitUp will network your phone with the rest of the sports fans in the stadium to create a visual phenomenon unlike anything seen before. By timing the pulses of your phone's flash, GetLitUp will create stunning effects and make every crowd member an active participent in the game's experience.

Issues

In theory, we have a working app. In reality, the timing is not what we were hoping for. We are currently using the NSDate timeIntervalSince1970 to link up the phones in the expectation that this number would be, at least to an approximation, the same for all phones. This doesn't appear to be the case. We are going to continue to work with this application and hopefully get the timing to the point that the synchronization can create the effects we were hoping for.
